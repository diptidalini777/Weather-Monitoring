# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Overview**
This project is a real-time weather monitoring system designed to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, process it at regular intervals, and provide summarized insights like daily weather summaries, alerts based on configurable thresholds, and visualizations. The system continuously tracks weather for the major metros in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).


**Features**
-Fetch real-time weather data (temperature, weather conditions) at a configurable interval.
-Convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit based on user preference).
-Calculate daily weather summaries (average, max, min temperature, and dominant condition).
-Trigger alerts if temperature exceeds a defined threshold.
-Store and visualize historical trends.


**********Backend Setup**********

Navigate to the backend directory:
cd weatherMonitoring/backend

Install backend dependencies:
npm install
Configure .env file with your MongoDB connection string:
API_KEY=<your_openweather_api_key>
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.kcbvv.mongodb.net/weatherMonitoring?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

Start the backend server:
nodemon src/server.js
The backend will be running at http://localhost:5000.


*******Frontend Setup*******

Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd weatherMonitoring/frontend

Install frontend dependencies:
npm install

Run the frontend:
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.
